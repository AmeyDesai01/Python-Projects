Hello I am Amey Desai, I am learning python language and building projects from Beginner level to advance level

# Aim of the project:- To build a Tip Calculator

# Requirements:- Any python IDE and Understanding of Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

# Instructions :- 

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

# Example Input

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
```

# Example Output :- 
```
Each person should pay: $19.93
```

# How does this project works? :- 

 1. It will take total bill amount from user.
 2. Next It will ask how much tip you would like to give.
 3. Lastly How many people to split the bill.
 4. In backend It will convert tip in percentage.
 5. Then it will have total tip amount by multiplying bill amount with tip percentage.
 6. Then it will have total bill amount by adding bill amount and total tip amount.
 7. Then it will divide total bill amount with total number of person to get bill per person.
 8. Finally will get final amount by rounding of the bill per person upto two decimal points.
